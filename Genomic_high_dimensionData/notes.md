**Que: lets call x1 as center node, and x2 and x3 are boundary node. the 2 boundary nodes are equidistant to the center node and farther away from each other than they are from center node. The distance between x1 and x3 = distance between x1 and x2 = A. The distance between x2 and x3 = B.  what is the probability of x1 be neighbor of x2 and x3**

**ans:**

To calculate the probability of x1 being a neighbor of both x2 and x3, we need to consider the possible locations of the three points x1, x2, and x3 that satisfy the given conditions.

Let's assume that x1 is located at the origin (0, 0), and x2 and x3 are located on the x-axis at distances A from x1. We can also assume that x2 is located to the left of x3, i.e., x2 is at (-A/2, 0), and x3 is at (A/2, 0).

Now, we need to find the range of values of B that satisfies the given condition that x2 and x3 are equidistant from x1 and farther away from each other than from x1. We can use the distance formula to calculate the distances between the points:

    distance between x1 and x2 = sqrt((0 - (-A/2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = A/2

    distance between x1 and x3 = sqrt((0 - (A/2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = A/2

    distance between x2 and x3 = sqrt(((-A/2) - (A/2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = A

Since we know that x2 and x3 are equidistant from x1, we can set the two equations for distances between x1 and x2, and between x1 and x3, equal to each other:

    A/2 = A/2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

    A = A

This equation is always true, so there are no restrictions on the value of A.

Next, we need to find the range of values of B that satisfies the condition that x2 and x3 are farther away from each other than from x1. We can express this condition mathematically as:

    B > A/2

This inequality is true because the distance between x1 and either x2 or x3 is A/2, which is less than B.

Therefore, the probability of x1 being a neighbor of both x2 and x3 is zero, because there are no possible locations of the three points that satisfy the given conditions.
